A python Mini Project for the Introduction to Programming module (ICE4101) for my masters degree. 

This project is based on all types of search algorithms:
 - BFS (Breadth First Search)
 - DFS (Depth First Search)
 - HOTW (Hand on the Wall)
 - Random

These searches will be utilised to complete a variety of mazes such as Hampton Court Maze, Empty Maze and a Custom Maze. A GUI will display how
fast each search took to complete and how many steps were done. A comparison feature also assists the difference between each algorithm by complexity 
and reliablity. 


#Step-by-Step Guide
1. unzip the .zip in the same path of the MAZE_Solver_GUI_8.py
   
2. INPUT folder and OUTPUT folder should be into the python script path
if not, the script will create them with no issue
but in that case the INPUT folder will be empty so NO MAZES

4. Maze_Gen folder is a user folder the script does not interact with it 
it's used by the user to create the maze and save it in form of CSV (comma delimited) then copy/move the csv to the INPUT folder

5. the OUTPUT folder 
contain the exported images
NOTE: the images are saved with the algorithm name so if 2 mazes are exported the new one will over write the old one
