unzip the .zip in the same path of the MAZE_Solver_GUI_8.py

INPUT folder and OUTPUT folder should be into the python script path
if not, the script will create them with no issue
but in that case the INPUT folder will be empty so NO MAZES


Maze_Gen folder is a user folder the script does not interact with it 
it's used by the user to create the maze and save it in form of CSV (comma delimited) then copy/move the csv to the INPUT folder


the OUTPUT folder 
contain the exported images
NOTE: the images are saved with the algorithm name so if 2 mazes are exported the new one will over write the old one
